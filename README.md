# Chatroom app
## Portfolio showcase
---

**Frontend: React.js**

**Backend: Firebase**

### Highlights I have learned in this project: 
- Google authentication for user
- firebase data storage for storing data (messages)
- Organization of code
- installing and debugging dependencies (firebase, universal-cookie)
- Cookie and token creation
- React hooks

This project was challenging, but I felt a sense of acomplishment after seeing the app work properly.
The use of Google authentication powered with firebase was fun to integrate, and I have acquired
a few more tools under my belt after finishing this project.
